    <h2>Info</h2>
    <a>"Hello. You already know the basic information about me from my resume.
        I can tell you a little about myself. I am … years old, I have been working in my specialty for … years.
        I consciously decided to get a higher education in this specialty, because I like the profession and what it can give.
        I try to develop comprehensively, I like to receive new knowledge. Therefore, working in your company will be very useful for me.
        And I, in turn, will apply all my available knowledge so that the company becomes even more promising, and its income grows.
        Where I worked before, I managed to achieve significant results (list them). I really liked my previous job, but I want to move forward.
        I think it is your company that will give me such an opportunity.”</a>
